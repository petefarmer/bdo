       <h2>Who We Are</h2>
       <p id="thetext">
BDO PRO is laser focused on improving performance for our clients. We have unique insights into how
the world is becoming increasingly digital, and we believe that most companies must decide to embrace
this tectonic shift in their marketplace (the disruptors), or ignore this digital imperative at their peril
(and risk becoming one of the disrupted). 
       </p id="thetext">
       <p id="thetext">
We work jointly with our clients to understand what these
new technologies mean to them; both the threats and the opportunities. Then we prioritize and jointly
implement process, technology and digital solutions, always with an passion for creating a step change
in business performance.
       </p id="thetext">
       <h2>What We Do</h2>
       <p id="thetext">
In an increasingly digital world, we believe that performance improvement starts with the customer,
specifically understanding the customer journey across your holistic, end-to- end customer relationship.
No two clients are identical, but many have already collected a significant amount of market and
customer research. 
       </p id="thetext">
       <p id="thetext">
We build on that work to identify the most significant pain points, competitive
threats or opportunities for revenue enhancement, always with an eye toward building a business case
for change.
       </p id="thetext">
       <p id="thetext">
Improving the customer experience typically comes in three forms:
<ul id="thetext">
<li>adopting "system agnostic" process improvement,</li> 
<li>embracing game changing new technologies, or </li> 
<li>enhancing the customer experience, and long term relationship, through proprietary software development.</li>

       <h2> The "Seven Deadly Sins" of Digital Transformation in a Software Centric World </h2>
<p id="thetext">
Venture capitalist, Mark Andreesen, recently cautioned that, "Software is eating the world." While
many consider Andreesen a "Master of the Universe" in Silicon Valley, he is not a maniacal genius bent
on global domination. He is simply making a rational and sober observation that software will soon
become a dominant factor in everything we do, the things we buy, the food we eat, and the cars that we
drive (or don't drive). More importantly, the pace at which software is "eating the world" is accelerating
exponentially, and if business leaders fail to recognize and react to the impact on their marketplace,
they may realize too late that they have become digital dinosaurs.
</p id="thetext">
<p id="thetext">
Forward looking CEOs are beginning to embrace a new reality, that regardless of what business they are
in, from Automobiles to Insurance, they are ALSO in the software business. The CEO of GE, Jeff Immelt,
often says that "If you go to bed as an industrial company tonight, you will wake up as a software and
analytics company in the morning." CEOs are also becoming keenly aware of the tremendous threat this
new software reality poses to their existing business. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan recently
cautioned his peers that, "Silicon Valley is coming to Wall Street to eat our lunch...By using (software)
they can make loans in minutes that might take banks weeks." The degree to which companies embrace
software as part of their competitive arsenal will be key to their success or failure, whether they are a
market disruptor, or one of the disrupted.
</p id="thetext">
<p id="thetext">
Once CEOs realize that software will become a larger and more critical component to their
organizations' success, the next question is what to do about it. Most CEOs are not steeped in software
development knowledge, and they sometimes tend to fall back on old paradigms, believing that they
can delegate or outsource the problem to others. They do so at their peril. We've listed below some
typical mistakes we see CEOs make when addressing these issues. We call them The "Seven Deadly
Sins" of Digital Transformation in a Software Centric World.
</p>
<ol id="thetext">
 <li>Conflating Technology and Software Development - "I've got my team and a group of
consultants working on everything from big data and machine learning to the cloud and the
internet of things, so we've got software covered." 
  <p>Don't confuse new technologies with the people and processes required to 
  build the software that can take advantage of them. These
technologies may be game changers in certain industries; but your organization will not benefit
from any of them if you lack the people and processes required to build the software to take
advantage of them. 
</p>
<p>
Designing and implementing any of these effectively will require modern
people and process tools, including things like AGILE, CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous
Development) and Containers, which are often referred to holistically as "DevOps." DevOps
(a clipped compound of &quot;software DEVelopment&quot; and &quot;information technology OPerationS&quot;) is a
term used to refer to a set of practices that emphasize the collaboration and communication of
both software developers and information technology (IT) professionals while automating the
process of software delivery and infrastructure changes. It aims at establishing a culture and
environment where building, testing, and releasing software can happen rapidly, frequently, and
more reliably. DevOps is the enabler for all these other technologies, and without a robust DevOps
operation, you will most likely be late to the marketplace with new technology.
</p>

</li>

<li>Third Party Solutions - "We've already outsourced most of our IT, so I'll call our service
providers and ask them about this DevOps thing." 
 <p>
You can't outsource a competitive
advantage. Ten years ago, large systems integrators convinced large enterprises to outsource
"non-strategic" (usually almost all) of their systems and programmers. After all, these firms had
large pools of cheap, offshore resources and huge economies of scale in IT infrastructure.
Unfortunately, in a world where software is a key differentiator, a large group of third party
programmers on the other side of the globe is an unlikely source of competitive advantage. And
those economies of scale from large systems integrators? Compared to cloud infrastructure
from Amazon, Google and others, the integrators look like guppies swimming with whales,
except in this case, the whales are far more nimble. If you're not looking to insource software
developers in strategic areas, or you're not looking at the cost and flexibility advantages of the
cloud, then you'll soon be swimming with the guppies.
 </p>
</li>

<li>Reliance on Packaged Based Solutions - "We are great at software development. My IT group
installed our latest ERP system in record time."
 <p>
There is a difference between proficiency at
implementing software packages and excellence in building software. Your IT organization may
be very good at installing and maintaining SalesForce.com or SAP, but that is a far cry from
building and deploying proprietary software that will drive success in the marketplace. With
87% of the Fortune 2000 running SAP, it is unlikely to be a source of your competitive
advantage. You may already use a systems integrator who may tell you that they can be part of
your DevOps solution, and they may very well be part of the solution. However, they have two
huge disadvantages:

  <ol>
    <li>They built their businesses on process conformity and fungible
resources, so building unique, innovative software is probably not their strength. 
    </li>
    <li>
    They need to "feed the beast." Most systems integrators have invested heavily in low cost resources 
   and expensive IT infrastructure. Not one of them is going to tell you that you need to insource
software development and move off their servers onto the cloud. Packaged software and
systems integrators still have their place, but companies need to identify and invest in the
proprietary software, and the people to build it, if they want to differentiate themselves in the
marketplace.
    </li>
  </ol>
 </p>
</li>

<li>Flight to Health - "I've instructed my IT team to deploy DevOps across the enterprise and I
expect we will be up and running in 60 days." 
<p>
Building a competent, competitive software
development (DevOps) organization does not happen overnight. Modern DevOps software
development requires a level of culture change, collaboration, and teamwork that that can only
be achieved through a focused and sustained effort. DevOps development lowers costs and
compresses cycle times through radical changes in processes and behaviors. Many of these
changes can be way outside the comfort zone of traditional software developers. A lot of
people become programmers because they like the solitude of the job, and they don't like
teamwork, meetings and collaboration, all hallmarks of modern DevOps processes and
practices. Since DevOps software development is generally more efficient than traditional
methods, it often requires fewer people, so choosing the ones who can make the changes and
redeploying those that cannot is critical to managing the change.
</p>

</li>

<li>Lip Service - "We're implementing DevOps, but it's not a big change. We're doing a lot of this
already." 
<p>
As with any major change, it can be helpful to get grounded in what will remain the
same. However, many tools and techniques that embody DevOps didn't exist even 12 months
ago, so if not much is changing, there's a good chance that your organization is not truly
embracing DevOps. Uber (who has embraced DevOps) does not represent a big change from
Yellow Cab's service, but 5 years after Uber's launch, Yellow Cab has been unable to replicate
the software that can match Uber's customer experience. Many of the tasks performed in a
DevOps environment will be the same as traditional software development, but the sequencing,
concurrency, integration, and quality testing will be dramatically different.
 </p>
</li>

<li>Low Expectations - "We are embracing DevOps as a best practice, and we expect to see
gradual improvements in performance over time." 
 <p>
That may sound like a valid expectation,
but most executive teams who embrace DevOps fully expect to see step change improvements
in software delivery in both cycle times and costs. The 20/20 rule is a good rule of thumb.
While there are no set rules, most companies typically see a 20% reduction in cost combined
with a 20% improvement in cycle time delivery, or some other combination of the two.
Companies whose strategy depends upon a commoditized product or service may be satisfied
with a 40% reduction in cost without much cycle time benefit. Other companies may see
software delivery and innovation as a priority, in which case they may maintain their cost base
but ask their software developers to deliver almost twice as fast as they had in the past. At any
rate, if your software budget and deliverables in the next 12 months look a lot like what you
delivered in the last 12 months, you may want to ask yourself if you are adopting
DevOps/Software development best practices, or just paying it lip service.
 </p>
</li>

<li>Siloed Solutions - "Our DevOps initiative is focused on our IT department." 
 <p>
Because DevOps is
focused on building better software, it is easy to think of it a solely an IT initiative. That mindset
will sub optimize the impact the DevOps can have on your overall business. DevOps will be a
game changer across your entire enterprise, from the way you interact with customers and
distributors to how you deal with suppliers and partners. In the traditional software
development world "users" would request new or modified software, and the IT department
would go away and come back in 3 to 9 months with a software update. This "big bang"
approach (also referred to as the "waterfall" approach because tasked trickled down
sequentially) was often riddled with release delays and software bugs. In the DevOps world
software is developed concurrently, often with several releases implemented each day. This
requires much closer collaboration between programmers and the rest of the organization. To
fully take advantage of these capabilities users need to understand them, then rethink and
reprioritize their software needs. They need to be constantly aware of daily software releases
and how they will use that to their advantage in the marketplace.
Once you realize that you are (at least partially) in the software business, and that it will be critical to the future success of your enterprise, the next obvious question is, "How good is my company at building
software today, and how can we get better at itâ"
